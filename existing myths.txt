---- Bushongo ----:

In the beginning, there was only darkness and water. In this vast, primordial ocean, a god named Mbombo dwelled. Inside the darkness of the water, Mbombo felt a great discomfort and restlessness. He had an urge to create and bring order to the chaos that surrounded him.

One day, Mbombo experienced a violent fit of nausea, and he vomited out the sun. The sun illuminated the dark waters and brought light to the world. Mbombo's vomiting continued, and he brought forth the moon, stars, and finally, the Earth. The Earth was flat and covered in lush green vegetation.

As the sun shone upon the Earth, Mbombo began to experience another bout of discomfort. This time, he had a severe stomachache, and he vomited once more. From his mouth emerged nine animals representing different aspects of the world: the leopard, the eagle, the crocodile, the turtle, the serpent, the white heron, the fish, the tortoise, and the lightning bird.

The animals roamed the Earth, shaping the landscape and nature as they interacted with it. The leopard created hills and mountains with its claws, the crocodile dug rivers and valleys with its tail, and the serpent slithered through the ground, forming tunnels. Gradually, the Earth took on its diverse and varied terrain.

Mbombo continued to feel a great urge to create, so he summoned one of the animals, the white heron, to aid him in forming humanity. He instructed the bird to gather clay from the Earth, and from this clay, Mbombo shaped the first man and woman.

To complete the creation of humans, Mbombo breathed life into the clay figures, and they came alive. The man was named Woto, and the woman was named Labama. They were the ancestors of the Bushongo people, and from them, the human population began to grow.

Mbombo watched over his creation and guided the early humans, teaching them various skills and providing them with knowledge. Thus, the world and all its inhabitants came into existence through Mbombo's creative acts.

The Bushongo creation myth reflects the cultural beliefs and origin stories of the Kuba people, emphasizing the importance of their relationship with the natural world and their connection to the divine. Like many creation myths, it seeks to explain the origins of humanity, the Earth, and the cosmos while providing a framework for understanding the Bushongo people's place in the universe.


---- Ancient greek ----:

The ancient Greeks had various creation myths, but one of the most well-known and widely accepted versions comes from Hesiod's "Theogony," a poem written around the 8th century BCE. According to this myth, the creation of the world began with Chaos, a formless void, from which the first deities emerged.

Chaos: The primeval state of nothingness, a void without form or order.

Gaia (Earth) and Tartarus (the Underworld): From Chaos, Gaia (Earth) came into existence, representing the physical world. Tartarus, the dark and gloomy abyss, was also born, serving as the lower realm.

Eros (Love): Sometimes considered the first being to emerge, Eros represents the force of love and attraction that brought order and harmony to the chaotic elements.

Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night): Erebus, a region of darkness, and Nyx, the goddess of night, were born from Chaos, representing the primordial darkness.

Erebos (Shadow) and Aether (Light): Erebos, personifying shadow, and Aether, representing light, also emerged.

Gaia's Children: Gaia, the Earth, gave birth to Uranus (Sky), Ourea (Mountains), and Pontus (Sea).

Uranus and Gaia: Uranus became the sky god and married Gaia, forming a cosmic union.

Titans: Uranus and Gaia had twelve children known as the Titans, including Cronus, Oceanus, Hyperion, Rhea, and others.

The Castration of Uranus: Cronus, encouraged by Gaia, castrated Uranus with a sickle and dethroned him, becoming the new ruler of the cosmos.

Birth of the Olympian Gods: Cronus married his sister Rhea, and they became the parents of the Olympian gods, including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades.

The Titanomachy: Cronus, fearing a prophecy that he would be overthrown by his children, swallowed them as soon as they were born. However, Rhea managed to save Zeus, who eventually led a rebellion against Cronus and the Titans, resulting in the Titanomachy (the battle between the Olympian gods and the Titans).

Zeus' Victory: With the help of the Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires, Zeus defeated the Titans and imprisoned them in Tartarus, becoming the supreme ruler of the cosmos.

This is a brief overview of the ancient Greek creation myth according to Hesiod's "Theogony." There were other creation myths in Greek mythology, as different regions and poets had their own variations. Nonetheless, this version provides a general understanding of how the ancient Greeks perceived the origin of the world and the gods.


---- Babylon ---:
The Babylonian creation myth is known as the "Enuma Elish," which means "When on High" in Akkadian, the ancient language of Mesopotamia. The Enuma Elish is a significant Babylonian epic that dates back to the 18th century BCE, and it was written to explain the origins of the world, the gods, and the rise of the Babylonian god Marduk as the supreme deity. The myth was recorded on seven clay tablets and discovered in the ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh (in modern-day Iraq).

Here is an abridged summary of the Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elish:

Primordial Chaos: The myth begins with the primordial state of the universe, represented by the waters of the god Apsu (freshwater) and the goddess Tiamat (saltwater), symbolizing chaos and the mingling of elements.

The Birth of the Gods: From the union of Apsu and Tiamat, several deities, the first generation of gods, are born. These gods are associated with natural elements and celestial bodies.

The Annoyance of Apsu: The younger gods are noisy and disturb the peace of Apsu and Tiamat. Apsu, troubled by their clamor, plans to destroy them.

Ea's Plot: Ea (Enki), one of the younger gods, learns of Apsu's plan and decides to act to protect the gods. While Apsu sleeps, Ea kills him, putting an end to the threat.

Tiamat's Rage: Upon learning of Apsu's death, Tiamat is consumed with grief and rage. She vows to avenge her mate and create an army of monsters to wage war against the younger gods.

The Rise of Marduk: The gods are terrified of Tiamat's fury, but they find hope in Marduk, the god of Babylon. They offer him the position of supreme deity if he can defeat Tiamat.

Marduk's Battle: Marduk accepts the challenge and prepares for battle. He equips himself with powerful weapons and a windswept chariot. Marduk faces Tiamat in a fierce encounter and ultimately defeats her, splitting her in two with an arrow.

Creation of the World: After defeating Tiamat, Marduk uses her body to create the heavens and the earth. He establishes the celestial bodies and arranges the universe.

Creation of Humanity: Marduk and the other gods decide to create humans to serve as their servants and to ensure that the gods can rest and be worshipped.

The Enthronement of Marduk: The gods celebrate Marduk's victory and his ascent to the highest position among the gods. They bestow upon him fifty names, signifying his authority.

The Enuma Elish is not only a creation myth but also a political and religious text that glorifies the city of Babylon and its patron god Marduk. It reflects the Babylonians' worldview and their belief in the supremacy of their city and god in the pantheon. The myth served to legitimize the rule of Babylonian kings, who claimed to be divinely appointed by Marduk.
